## Tech Stack for HESTIA

When designing a logging and monitoring stack, we needed a **robust, scalable, and efficient** system that can **process, store, visualize, and analyze logs** effectively. Below is the reasoning behind our choices:

---

### **üõ¢Ô∏è Logstash - The Log Processor**

**Why we chose Logstash?**
- Logstash acts as a **centralized log collector and processor**.
- It can **ingest logs from multiple sources** (Hestia Logger, system logs, other applications).
- It provides **powerful filtering**, allowing us to format logs before sending them to storage.
- **Seamless integration with Elasticsearch**, making it the best choice for feeding logs into our system.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Fluentd** ‚Äì Lighter than Logstash but lacks powerful filtering.
- **Filebeat** ‚Äì More efficient for forwarding logs, but doesn‚Äôt allow complex processing like Logstash.

**üèÖ Why Logstash Won?**

- **Best choice for structured and enriched log processing.**  
- **Flexibility to handle multiple log formats (JSON, plaintext, syslogs, etc.).**  
- **Easily integrates with Elasticsearch, reducing setup complexity.**

### **üîç Elasticsearch - The Log Storage & Search Engine**

**Why we chose Elasticsearch?**
- Elasticsearch is a **distributed search and analytics engine**, optimized for storing and querying logs efficiently.
- Provides **full-text search**, meaning we can easily search for specific logs.
- Supports **indexing and real-time querying**, allowing logs to be searchable as soon as they arrive.
- Handles **large-scale data storage**, making it future-proof for expanding logging needs.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **MongoDB** ‚Äì Could store logs but lacks efficient log searching and indexing.
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì A strong relational database, but not optimized for log storage.
- **Loki (Grafana)** ‚Äì Better for structured logs but lacks strong full-text search.

**üèÖ Why Elasticsearch Won?**

- **Designed for handling and searching logs at scale.**  
- **Built-in indexing and near real-time search.**  
- **Seamless integration with Logstash and Kibana.**

### **üìä Kibana - The Log Visualization Tool**

**Why we chose Kibana?**
- Kibana provides a **powerful UI** to search and explore logs stored in Elasticsearch.
- Includes **Discover, Dashboards, and Alerts**, making log analysis easier.
- Allows **real-time monitoring** of logs with customizable filters and views.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Grafana (directly with Elasticsearch)** ‚Äì Good but lacks native log search and filtering.
- **Graylog** ‚Äì A dedicated log analysis tool, but more complex than Kibana.

**üèÖ Why Kibana Won?**

- **Best tool for interactive log exploration and search.**  
- **Easy to set up with Elasticsearch.**  
- **Built-in dashboards for monitoring log trends.**  

---

### **üé® Grafana - Advanced Monitoring & Dashboards**

**Why we chose Grafana?**
- Grafana **extends our log monitoring capabilities** by allowing custom dashboards.
- **Supports multiple data sources**, including Elasticsearch, Prometheus, and more.
- Provides **rich visualizations** like time-series graphs, alerts, and heatmaps.
- **More advanced alerting and dashboarding than Kibana.**

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Kibana (only)** ‚Äì Can visualize logs but lacks advanced monitoring.
- **Loki (with Grafana)** ‚Äì Good for structured logs, but we wanted full-text search.

**üèÖ Why Grafana Won?**

- **More flexible than Kibana for monitoring dashboards.**  
- **Supports multiple data sources, making it future-proof.**  
- **Custom alerting, allowing proactive monitoring of logs.**
