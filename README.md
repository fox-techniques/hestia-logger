🔥 Key Takeaways

✅ Logging is complex! Even when everything looks right, logs can be filtered, blocked, or lost.
✅ Always check if emit() is running. If emit() is never called, logs will NEVER be written.
✅ Python’s logging system sometimes filters logs before they reach handlers.
✅ Manually handling log records (handle(record)) can prevent logs from being lost.
✅ Debug step by step. Printing debug messages at each stage helped us pinpoint the issue.

🚀 The Final Working Flow

1️⃣ logger.info("message") → Sends log to Python’s logging system.
2️⃣ Log reaches file_handler_app.emit(record) → This now actually executes.
3️⃣ emit(record) calls _write_log() → _write_log() now runs immediately.
4️⃣ aiofiles.open() writes logs → app.log is now properly created and updated! 🎉
🎉 Final Words

This was a long journey, but we fixed a tricky logging issue step by step!
Now you have a fully working async logging system that is reliable, structured, and writes logs correctly. 🚀

✅ If you ever face a logging issue again, now you know how to debug it!
Congratulations on solving this major issue! 🎉🔥
